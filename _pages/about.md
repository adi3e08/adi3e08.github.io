Welcome to my homepage !

I received my Dual Degree (B.Tech, M.Tech) in [Engineering Design](https://ed.iitm.ac.in){:target="_blank"} from [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/){:target="_blank"}, India in 2016. Most recently, between June 2018 and March 2021, I spent three years as a Research Engineer at [Honeywell](https://www.honeywell.com){:target="_blank"}, Bengaluru, India.

I am interested in deep reinforcement learning, in particular, itâ€™s application to embodied AI, autonomous systems and robotics. I have applied deep reinforcement learning to problems such as multi-agent co-operation and autonomous navigation for UAVs.

I have a strong multidisciplinary engineering background. In the past, I have also worked on problems in supervised learning, robotics and dynamical systems. You can view my detailed CV [here](https://adi3e08.github.io/files/cv.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
