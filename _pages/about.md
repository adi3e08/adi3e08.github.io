Welcome to my homepage !

I am currently a Research Fellow at the Robert Bosch Centre for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence ([RBCDSAI](https://rbcdsai.iitm.ac.in/){:target="_blank"}), IIT Madras, working on deep reinforcement learning under the guidance of [Prof. Balaraman Ravindran](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/){:target="_blank"}. Earlier, between 2018 and 2021, I spent three years as a Research Engineer at [Honeywell](https://www.honeywell.com){:target="_blank"}. Before that, I briefly worked in a healthcare start-up. Prior to that, I spent a year working on my own product idea, a domestic robot. I received my Dual Degree (B.Tech, M.Tech) in [Engineering Design](https://ed.iitm.ac.in){:target="_blank"} from [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/){:target="_blank"} in 2016, with a minor in control systems engineering.

I am interested in developing intelligent robots that can carry out complex tasks in the physical world with the same ease as humans. Such a robot must be able to perceive its environment, interact with it, learn to perform tasks through trial and error, and continue to learn many tasks over its lifetime, efficiently and effectively. To this end, I am interested in deep learning, reinforcement learning (RL) and robotics. In particular, I am interested in RL. Currently, my work is focused on improving model-based RL for robotics, through better inductive biases based on the underlying physics. Earlier, I have applied model-free RL to robotics problems such as multi-agent co-operation and autonomous navigation for UAVs.

In the past, I have worked on other areas of engineering and science. I have applied deep learning to problems in computer vision and speech recognition. I have worked on flight control for UAVs and studied the dynamics of robotic manipulators. For my dual degree project at IIT Madras, I worked in the area of quantum chaos under the guidance of <br> [Prof. Arul Lakshminarayan](https://physics.iitm.ac.in/~arul/index.html){:target="_blank"} and [Prof. Sandipan Bandyopadhyay](https://ed.iitm.ac.in/~sandipan/){:target="_blank"}.
