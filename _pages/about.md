I am interested in Machine Learning for Robotics, especially Deep Reinforcement Learning.

Background
======
I graduated with a Dual Degree (B.Tech and M.Tech) in [Engineering Design](https://ed.iitm.ac.in) from IIT Madras in 2016. It was a multidisciplinary program whose aim was to develop well rounded engineers with exposure to different branches of engineering, who can design engineering products. The core course work dealt with different aspects of design, namely, mechanical, electronics, controls, and embedded systems along with courses in geometric modelling, finite elements, materials engineering and automotive engineering. 

Apart from core coursework, I had quite a bit of freedom in choosing electives. As someone who loved Maths and Physics, I mostly chose electives which were Math intensive. I studied two courses on Robotic Manipulation. My minor was in Systems Engineering, where I learnt about Optimization and Control Theory. For my Dual Degree Project, I worked on Quantum Chaos with [Professor Arul Lakshminarayan](https://physics.iitm.ac.in/~arul/index.html). If I had not come across Machine Learning during my final year, I would have most likely pursued Physics as a career.
