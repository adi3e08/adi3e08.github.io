<p>Welcome to my homepage!</p>

<p>I am currently a Research Associate at the <a href="https://rbcdsai.iitm.ac.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Robert Bosch Centre for Data Science and AI, IIT Madras</a>, working with <a href="https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof. Balaraman Ravindran</a>. Prior to this, I spent three years as a Research Engineer at <a href="https://www.honeywell.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Honeywell</a>. I received my Dual Degree (B.Tech, M.Tech) in <a href="https://ed.iitm.ac.in" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Engineering Design</a> from <a href="https://www.iitm.ac.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IIT Madras</a> in 2016.</p>

<p>I am interested in developing intelligent robots, that can learn to carry out complex tasks in the physical world. To this end, I am interested in deep learning and reinforcement learning (RL). In particular, I am interested in RL. Currently, I work on physics-informed model-based RL.</p>
