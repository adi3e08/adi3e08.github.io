Welcome to my homepage!

I am interested in artificial general intelligence. In particular, I am interested in artificial physical intelligence - endowing robots with the ability to perceive, reason and act in the physical world. These days, I mainly work in deep reinforcement learning.

I am currently pursuing a Master's in robotics with a computer science concentration at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/){:target="blank"}. Prior to this, I spent two years as a Research Associate at [Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Madras](https://rbcdsai.iitm.ac.in/){:target="blank"}. Before that, I spent three years as a Research Scientist at [Honeywell](https://www.honeywell.com){:target="blank"}. I received my Dual Degree (B.Tech, M.Tech) in [Engineering Design](https://ed.iitm.ac.in){:target="blank"} from [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/){:target="blank"} in 2016. You can view my detailed CV [here](https://adi3e08.github.io/files/CV_Adithya_Ramesh.pdf){:target="blank"}.

I enjoy playing sports, particularly soccer and cricket. I also enjoy running and hiking. I love physics. I pursue physics as a hobby.
