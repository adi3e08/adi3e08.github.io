Welcome to my homepage !

**About me**

I received my Dual Degree (B.Tech and M.Tech) in [Engineering Design](https://ed.iitm.ac.in){:target="_blank"} from [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/){:target="_blank"}, India in 2016. Most recently, between June 2018 and March 2021, I spent three years as a Research Engineer at [Honeywell](https://www.honeywell.com){:target="_blank"}, Bengaluru, India.

I am interested in deep reinforcement learning, in particular, itâ€™s application to embodied AI, autonomous systems and robotics. I have applied deep reinforcement learning to problems such as multi-agent co-operation and autonomous navigation for UAVs.

I have a strong multidisciplinary engineering background. In the past, I have also worked on supervised learning - point cloud segmentation, speaker recognition, image classification / segmentation etc and robotics - state estimation and control for UAVs, numerical simulation of robotic manipulators etc. I am also passionate about physics. For my master's thesis at IIT Madras, I worked in the area of quantum chaos under the guidance of [Prof. Arul Lakshminarayan](https://physics.iitm.ac.in/~arul/index.html){:target="_blank"} and [Prof. Sandipan Bandyopadhyay](https://ed.iitm.ac.in/~sandipan/){:target="_blank"}.

You can find my detailed CV [here](https://adi3e08.github.io/files/cv.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
