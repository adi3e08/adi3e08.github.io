I am interested in Machine Learning for Robotics, especially Deep Reinforcement Learning.

Background
======
I graduated with a Dual Degree (B.Tech and M.Tech) in [Engineering Design](https://ed.iitm.ac.in) from IIT Madras in 2016. It was a multidisciplinary program whose aim was to develop well rounded engineers with exposure to different branches of engineering, namely mechanical, electronics and computer science, who can design engineering products from the ground up.
