Welcome to my homepage !

I am currently a Research Fellow at [RBCDSAI, IIT Madras](https://rbcdsai.iitm.ac.in/){:target="_blank"}, India, working on deep reinforcement learning under the guidance of [Prof. Balaraman Ravindran](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/){:target="_blank"}. Earlier, between 2018 and 2021, I spent three years as a Research Engineer at [Honeywell](https://www.honeywell.com){:target="_blank"}, Bengaluru, India. I received my Dual Degree (B.Tech, M.Tech) in [Engineering Design](https://ed.iitm.ac.in){:target="_blank"} from [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/){:target="_blank"}, India in 2016.

I am mainly interested in deep reinforcement learning, in particular, itâ€™s application to robotics. Currently, my work is focused on improving model-based reinforcement learning for robotics, through better inductive biases based on the underlying physics. Earlier, I have applied model-free deep reinforcement learning to problems such as multi-agent co-operation and autonomous navigation for UAVs.

In the past, I have worked on other areas of engineering and science. I have applied deep learning to problems in computer vision and speech recognition. I have worked on flight control for quadrotors and studied the dynamics of robotic manipulators. For my dual degree project at IIT Madras, I worked in the area of quantum physics under the guidance of [Prof. Arul Lakshminarayan](https://physics.iitm.ac.in/~arul/index.html){:target="_blank"} and [Prof. Sandipan Bandyopadhyay](https://ed.iitm.ac.in/~sandipan/){:target="_blank"}.
