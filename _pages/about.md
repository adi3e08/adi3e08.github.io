Welcome to my homepage!

I am interested in deep learning, reinforcement learning and robotics.

Recently, I spent two years as a Research Associate at [Robert Bosch Centre for Data Science and AI](https://rbcdsai.iitm.ac.in/){:target="blank"}, [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/){:target="blank"}. Before that, I spent three years as a Research Engineer at [Honeywell](https://www.honeywell.com){:target="blank"}. I received my Dual Degree (B.Tech, M.Tech) in [Engineering Design](https://ed.iitm.ac.in){:target="blank"} from [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/){:target="blank"} in 2016.

I enjoy playing sports, particularly football and cricket. I also enjoy running.
