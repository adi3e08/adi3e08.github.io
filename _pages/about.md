I am interested in Machine Learning for Robotics, especially Deep Reinforcement Learning.

Background
======
I graduated with a Dual Degree (B.Tech and M.Tech) in [Engineering Design](https://ed.iitm.ac.in) from [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) in 2016. My minor was in Systems Engineering. For my Dual Degree Project, I worked on Quantum Chaos with [Prof. Arul Lakshminarayan](https://physics.iitm.ac.in/~arul/index.html), co-guided by [Prof. Sandipan Bandyopadhyay](https://ed.iitm.ac.in/~sandipan/).
