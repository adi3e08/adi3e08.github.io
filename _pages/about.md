Welcome to my homepage !

**About me**

I received my Dual Degree (B.Tech and M.Tech) in [Engineering Design](https://ed.iitm.ac.in){:target="_blank"} from [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/){:target="_blank"} in 2016. Since then, I have spent a few years working in the industry. Most recently, between 2018 and 2021, I worked as a Research Engineer at [Honeywell Aerospace](https://aerospace.honeywell.com){:target="_blank"}, Bengaluru, India.

I am interested in deep reinforcement learning (deep RL), in particular, itâ€™s application to autonomous systems and robotics. In the past, I have applied deep RL to problems such as multi-agent co-operation and autonomous navigation for UAVs.

I have a strong multidisciplinary engineering background. Other areas I have worked on in the past include, supervised learning (point cloud segmentation, speaker recognition, image classification/segmentation), state estimation and control for UAVs and robotic manipulation.

I also enjoy physics. As part of my master's thesis at IIT Madras, I worked on quantum chaos under the guidance of [Prof. Arul Lakshminarayan](https://physics.iitm.ac.in/~arul/index.html){:target="_blank"} and [Prof. Sandipan Bandyopadhyay](https://ed.iitm.ac.in/~sandipan/){:target="_blank"}. 

You can find my detailed CV [here](https://adi3e08.github.io/files/cv.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
