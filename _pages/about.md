Welcome to my homepage!

I am currently pursuing a Master's in Robotics with a Computer Science concentration at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/){:target="blank"}. Here, I work with Prof. X. I am interested in robot learning, i. e, endowing robots with the ability to learn to carry out complex tasks in the physical world. To this end, I am interested in deep learning, reinforcement learning (RL) and robotics. In particular, I am interested in RL. Currently, I work on representation learning for RL.

Prior to this, I spent two years as a Research Associate at the [Robert Bosch Centre for Data Science and AI, IIT Madras](https://rbcdsai.iitm.ac.in/){:target="blank"}, where I worked with [Prof. Balaraman Ravindran](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/){:target="blank"}. Earlier, I spent three years as a Research Engineer at [Honeywell](https://www.honeywell.com){:target="blank"}. I received my Dual Degree (B.Tech, M.Tech) in [Engineering Design](https://ed.iitm.ac.in){:target="blank"} from [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/){:target="blank"} in 2016. You can view my detailed CV [here](https://adi3e08.github.io/files/CV_Adithya_Ramesh.pdf){:target="blank"}.

I enjoy playing sports, particularly soccer and cricket. I also enjoy running and hiking. I love physics. I pursue physics as a hobby.
