Welcome to my homepage !

I am currently a Research Fellow at Robert Bosch Centre for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence ([RBCDSAI](https://rbcdsai.iitm.ac.in/){:target="_blank"}), IIT Madras, working on deep reinforcement learning with <br> [Professor Balaraman Ravindran](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/){:target="_blank"}. Earlier, between 2018 and 2021, I spent three years as a Research Engineer at [Honeywell](https://www.honeywell.com){:target="_blank"}. I received my Dual Degree (B.Tech, M.Tech) in [Engineering Design](https://ed.iitm.ac.in){:target="_blank"} from [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/){:target="_blank"} in 2016, with a minor in control systems engineering.

I am interested in developing intelligent systems that can carry out complex tasks in the physical world with the same ease as humans. Such a system must be able to perceive its environment, interact with it and learn from experience. To this end, I am interested in deep learning, reinforcement learning (RL) and robotics. In particular, I am interested in RL. Currently, my work is focused on improving model-based RL for robotics, through better inductive biases based on the underlying physics. Earlier, I have applied model-free RL to problems such as multi-agent co-operation and autonomous navigation for UAVs.

In the past, I have worked on other areas of engineering and science. I have applied deep learning to problems in computer vision and speech recognition. I have worked on flight control for UAVs and studied the dynamics of robotic manipulators. For my master's thesis at IIT Madras, I studied the connections between chaos and quantum entanglement, with <br> [Professor Arul Lakshminarayan](https://sites.google.com/view/arulakshminarayan){:target="_blank"}.
