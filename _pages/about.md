Welcome to my homepage!

I am currently a Research Fellow at the [Robert Bosch Centre for Data Science and AI](https://rbcdsai.iitm.ac.in/){:target="_blank"}, working with [Prof. Balaraman Ravindran](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/){:target="_blank"}. Prior to this, I spent three years as a Research Engineer at [Honeywell](https://www.honeywell.com){:target="_blank"}. I received my Dual Degree (B.Tech, M.Tech) in [Engineering Design](https://ed.iitm.ac.in){:target="_blank"} from [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/){:target="_blank"} in 2016.

I am interested in developing intelligent systems, that can learn to carry out complex tasks in the physical world. To this end, I am interested in deep learning, reinforcement learning (RL) and robotics. Currently, my work is focused on improving model-based RL for robotics, through better inductive biases based on the underlying physics.

You can view my detailed CV [here](https://adi3e08.github.io/files/cv.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
