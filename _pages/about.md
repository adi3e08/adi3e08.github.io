Broadly, I am interested in solving impactful real world problems through science and technology.

In particular, I am interested in Machine Learning for Robotics, especially Deep Reinforcement Learning.

Background
======
I graduated with a Dual Degree (B.Tech and M.Tech) in [Engineering Design] (https://ed.iitm.ac.in) from IIT Madras in 2016. It was a multidisciplinary program which exposed me to different branches of engineering and taught me the fundamentals of designing an engineering product. My minor was in Systems Engineering, where I learnt about Optimization and Control Theory. IFor my Dual Degree Project, I worked on Quantum Chaos with [Professor Arul Lakshminarayan] (https://physics.iitm.ac.in/~arul/index.html). If I had not come across Machine Learning during my final year, I would have most likely pursued Physics as a career.
