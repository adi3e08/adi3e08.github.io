I received my Dual Degree (B.Tech and M.Tech) in [Engineering Design](https://ed.iitm.ac.in){:target="_blank"} from [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/){:target="_blank"} in 2016. Since graduating, I have spent a few years working in the industry. Most recently, between 2018 and 2021, I worked as a R & D Engineer/Scientist at [Honeywell Aerospace](https://aerospace.honeywell.com){:target="_blank"}, Bengaluru, India.

I am interested in deep learning and reinforcement learning (RL), in particular, their application to robotics. In the past, I have applied deep RL to problems such as multi-agent co-operation and autonomous navigation. I have a strong multidisciplinary engineering background.
