I received my Dual Degree (B.Tech and M.Tech) in [Engineering Design](https://ed.iitm.ac.in){:target="_blank"} from [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/){:target="_blank"} in 2016. Since then, I have spent a few years working in the industry. Most recently, between 2018 and 2021, I worked as a Research Engineer at [Honeywell Aerospace](https://aerospace.honeywell.com){:target="_blank"}, Bengaluru, India.

I am interested in deep reinforcement learning (deep RL), in particular, it's application to autonomous systems and robotics. I have applied deep RL to problems such as multi-agent co-operation and autonomous navigation. I have a strong multidisciplinary engineering and science background. Other areas I have worked on in the past include, supervised learning (point cloud segmentation, speaker recognition, image classification/segmentation), quantum chaos, state estimation and control for UAVs and robotic manipulation.

In my free time, I enjoy playing football and running, among other things. I am a hobby physicist.
