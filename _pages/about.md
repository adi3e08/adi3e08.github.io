Welcome to my homepage!

I am interested in developing intelligent robots that can learn to carry out complex tasks in the physical world. To this end, I am interested in deep learning, reinforcement learning and robotics.

I spent two years as a Project Associate at [Robert Bosch Centre for Data Science and AI](https://rbcdsai.iitm.ac.in/){:target="blank"}, [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/){:target="blank"}. Before that, I spent three years as a Research Engineer at [Honeywell](https://www.honeywell.com){:target="blank"}. I received my Dual Degree (B.Tech, M.Tech) in [Engineering Design](https://ed.iitm.ac.in){:target="blank"} from [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/){:target="blank"} in 2016. You can view my detailed resume [here](https://adi3e08.github.io/files/resume.pdf){:target="blank"}.

I enjoy playing sports, particularly football and cricket. I also enjoy running and hiking. I love physics. I pursue physics as a hobby.
