Welcome to my homepage!

I am currently a Research Fellow at the [Robert Bosch Centre for Data Science and AI](https://rbcdsai.iitm.ac.in/){:target="blank"}, working with [Prof. Balaraman Ravindran](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/){:target="blank"}. Prior to this, I spent three years as a Research Engineer at [Honeywell](https://www.honeywell.com){:target="blank"}. I received my Dual Degree (B.Tech, M.Tech) in [Engineering Design](https://ed.iitm.ac.in){:target="blank"} from [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/){:target="blank"} in 2016.

I am interested in developing intelligent systems that can perceive the physical world, interact with it and learn from experience, to carry out complex tasks. To this end, I am interested in deep learning, reinforcement learning (RL) and robotics. In particular, I am interested in RL. Currently, my work is focused on improving model-based RL performance in robotics tasks, through physics-based inductive biases.
