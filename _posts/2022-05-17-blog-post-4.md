Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), is a deep RL algorithm for continuous action spaces. It is model-free, off-policy and adopts an actor-critic
approach. As the name suggests, DDPG uses deterministic policies.

DDPG mainly draws from two previous papers, Deep Q Networks (DQN) and Deterministic Policy Gradients (DPG).
