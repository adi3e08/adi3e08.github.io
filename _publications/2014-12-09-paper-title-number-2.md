This work represents a project carried out by me as part of a Robotic Manipulation course at IIT Madras.

Studied chaotic dynamics in robotic manipulation that can occur for certain values of controller gains and model mismatch.

Simulated a parallel manipulator - a planar 5-bar, to track a periodic trajectory. Calculated Lyapunov exponents and plotted phase space plots to identify chaotic dynamics.

Note : The general typesetting of the report, especially mathematical expressions could have been better. I was unaware of Latex at the time !
