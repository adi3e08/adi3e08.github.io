This work represents a project carried out by me as part of a Robotic Manipulation course taught by [Dr. Sandipan Bandyopadhyay](https://ed.iitm.ac.in/~sandipan/){:target="_blank"} at IIT Madras.

We studied chaotic dynamics in robotic manipulation that can occur for certain values of controller gains and model mismatch.

We simulated a parallel manipulator - a planar 5-bar, to track a periodic trajectory. We calculated Lyapunov exponents and plotted phase space plots to identify chaotic dynamics.
